# Script Analyzer Data 1
Overview
ScriptAnalyzer is a Python class designed to analyze C/C++ scripts for various coding standards and best practices. It checks for issues such as indentation errors, naming convention violations, code modularization, file encoding, consistency, code reuse, whitespace usage, and memory leaks.

Dependencies
Python 3.x
pycparser (for parsing C scripts)
For memory leak checks:
Windows: Dr. Memory tool
Linux/Mac: Valgrind
Usage
Initialize the ScriptAnalyzer class with the path to the script you want to analyze.
Call the run_analysis() method to perform the analysis.
The analysis results will be logged in a file and emailed to the specified recipient.
Methods
run_analysis(): Performs the complete analysis of the script.
check_indentation(): Checks for indentation errors in the script.
check_naming_conventions(): Checks for naming convention violations in variables, functions, and types/classes.
check_modularization(): Checks if the script is adequately modularized with a minimum number of functions and subroutines.
check_file_encoding(): Checks the file encoding of the script (assumes UTF-8).
check_consistency(): Checks for consistency issues such as line endings and syntax at the end of the file.
check_code_reuse(): Checks for possible code duplication.
check_whitespace(): Checks for excessive whitespace within lines and at the end of lines.
check_memory_leaks(): Checks for memory leaks in the C++ script (requires external tools).
Configuration
Set global indentation spaces (INDENTATION_SPACES) and iteration values (ITERATION_VALUES) at the beginning of the code.
Logging
Logs are saved in the "Logs" folder with filenames formatted as <script_name>-at-<timestamp>.log.
Email Notification
Results are emailed to the specified recipient using the SMTP server smtp-mail.outlook.com and port 587.

# Script Analyzer Data 2

## Overview
The Script Analyzer is a tool designed to analyze and identify potential issues in scripts written in C/C++ programming languages. It performs various checks to ensure the script's readability, maintainability, and adherence to coding standards. The tool generates a log file containing warnings and errors, which can be used to improve the quality of the scripts.

## Features
- **Total Lines Check**: Verifies if the total number of lines in the script exceeds the recommended maximum.
- **Indentation Check**: Ensures consistent and proper indentation throughout the script.
- **Naming Conventions Check**: Checks if functions, variables, and types adhere to naming conventions.
- **Modularization Check**: Identifies repeated sequences of code that can be refactored into functions.
- **File Encoding Check**: Verifies if the file encoding is correct (UTF-8).
- **Consistency Check**: Ensures consistent line endings and syntax at the end of the file.
- **Code Reuse Check**: Detects potential code duplication or reuse issues.
- **Whitespace Check**: Identifies excessive whitespace and trailing spaces within lines.

## Setup
1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
2. Install the required dependencies by running:
   ```
   pip install pycparser
   ```
3. Update the `SENDER_EMAIL`, `SENDER_PASSWORD`, `RECIPIENT_EMAIL`, `SMTP_SERVER`, and `SMTP_PORT` constants in the script with your email credentials and server details.

## Usage
1. Run the script analyzer by providing the path to the script you want to analyze (e.g., `python script_analyzer.py`).
2. Review the generated log file for warnings and errors.
3. Refactor the script based on the analysis results to improve its quality and maintainability.

## Notes
- The tool can be extended to include additional checks or functionality based on specific requirements.
- Ensure the script to be analyzed is written in C/C++ and has the correct file extension (`.c` or `.cpp`).

# Script Analyzer

## Overview
The Script Analyzer is a Python script designed to analyze C/C++ scripts for various coding standards and practices. It performs checks related to indentation, naming conventions, modularization, file encoding, consistency, code reuse, and memory leaks. Additionally, it can email a log file with analysis results to a specified recipient.

## How to Use
1. **Environment Setup:** Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. **Clone the Repository:** Clone the repository containing the Script Analyzer code.
3. **Install Dependencies:** Install the required Python dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. **Run the Script:** Execute the script by providing the full path to the C/C++ script you want to analyze when prompted.

## Functions
1. **`ScriptAnalyzer` Class:**
   - `__init__(self, script_path)`: Initializes the Script Analyzer with the path to the script.
   - `run_analysis(self)`: Runs the analysis on the script, performing various checks and emailing the analysis log.

2. **Analysis Checks:**
   - `check_total_lines(self)`: Checks if the total number of lines in the script exceeds a recommended maximum.
   - `check_indentation(self)`: Checks for indentation issues in the script.
   - `check_naming_conventions(self)`: Checks for naming convention violations in variables, functions, and types.
   - `check_modularization(self)`: Checks for repeated sequences of code that could be refactored into functions.
   - `check_file_encoding(self)`: Checks the file encoding of the script.
   - `check_consistency(self)`: Checks for consistency issues in line endings and file syntax.
   - `check_code_reuse(self)`: Checks for possible code duplication through import or require statements.
   - `check_whitespace(self)`: Checks for excessive whitespace or trailing spaces in the script.
   - `check_memory_leaks(self)`: Checks for memory leaks in C/C++ scripts using Dr.Memory or Valgrind.

3. **Utility Functions:**
   - `get_log_file_name(self)`: Generates a unique log file name based on the script's name and current date/time.
   - `preprocess_cpp_file(self)`: Preprocesses a C/C++ script using the C preprocessor (`cpp`).

4. **Email Functionality:**
   - `send_email(sender_email, sender_password, recipient_email, attachment_path)`: Sends an email with an attached log file.

## Logic and Practicality
- The Script Analyzer employs a combination of regular expressions, AST parsing, and file I/O to perform various checks on C/C++ scripts.
- It utilizes logging to capture warnings and errors during analysis, providing a detailed log file for review.
- The modular design allows for easy extension with additional checks or functionality.
- The script's email functionality enables automatic sharing of analysis results with stakeholders.

## Additional Notes
- Ensure that the SMTP server configuration (SMTP_SERVER, SMTP_PORT, SENDER_EMAIL, SENDER_PASSWORD, RECIPIENT_EMAIL) is correctly set up for emailing log files.
- Some checks, such as memory leak detection, require external tools (Dr.Memory, Valgrind) to be installed and available in the system PATH.
