# Script Analyzer

## Overview
The Script Analyzer is a Python class designed to analyze C/C++ scripts for various coding standards and best practices. It checks for issues such as indentation errors, naming convention violations, code modularization, file encoding, consistency, code reuse, whitespace usage, and memory leaks.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- pycparser (for parsing C scripts)
- For memory leak checks:
  - Windows: Dr. Memory tool
  - Linux/Mac: Valgrind

## Setup
1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
2. Install the required dependencies by running:
   ```
   pip install pycparser
   ```
3. Update the `SENDER_EMAIL`, `SENDER_PASSWORD`, `RECIPIENT_EMAIL`, `SMTP_SERVER`, and `SMTP_PORT` constants in the script with your email credentials and server details.

## Usage
1. Initialize the ScriptAnalyzer class with the path to the script you want to analyze.
2. Call the `run_analysis()` method to perform the analysis.
3. The analysis results will be logged in a file and emailed to the specified recipient.

## Methods
- `run_analysis()`: Performs the complete analysis of the script.
- `check_indentation()`: Checks for indentation errors in the script.
- `check_naming_conventions()`: Checks for naming convention violations in variables, functions, and types/classes.
- `check_modularization()`: Checks if the script is adequately modularized with a minimum number of functions and subroutines.
- `check_file_encoding()`: Checks the file encoding of the script (assumes UTF-8).
- `check_consistency()`: Checks for consistency issues such as line endings and syntax at the end of the file.
- `check_code_reuse()`: Checks for possible code duplication.
- `check_whitespace()`: Checks for excessive whitespace within lines and at the end of lines.
- `check_memory_leaks()`: Checks for memory leaks in the C++ script (requires external tools).

## Configuration
- Set global indentation spaces (`INDENTATION_SPACES`) and iteration values (`ITERATION_VALUES`) at the beginning of the code.

## Logging
- Logs are saved in the "Logs" folder with filenames formatted as `<script_name>-at-<timestamp>.log`.

## Email Notification
- Results are emailed to the specified recipient using the SMTP server `smtp-mail.outlook.com` and port `587`.

## Logic and Practicality
- The Script Analyzer employs a combination of regular expressions, AST parsing, and file I/O to perform various checks on C/C++ scripts.
- It utilizes logging to capture warnings and errors during analysis, providing a detailed log file for review.
- The modular design allows for easy extension with additional checks or functionality.
- The script's email functionality enables automatic sharing of analysis results with stakeholders.

## Notes
- Ensure that the SMTP server configuration (SMTP_SERVER, SMTP_PORT, SENDER_EMAIL, SENDER_PASSWORD, RECIPIENT_EMAIL) is correctly set up for emailing log files.
- Some checks, such as memory leak detection, require external tools (Dr.Memory, Valgrind) to be installed and available in the system PATH.
